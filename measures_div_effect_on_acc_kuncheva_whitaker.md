# [Measures of Diversity in Classifier Ensembles and Their Relationship with the Ensemble Accuracy](http://machine-learning.martinsewell.com/ensembles/KunchevaWhitaker2003.pdf)

**Authors**: LUDMILA I. KUNCHEVA and CHRISTOPHER J. WHITAKER

* The authors compare the effect of diversity measured using: four averaged pairwise measures (the Q statistic, the correlation, the disagreement and the double fault) and six non-pairwise measures (the entropy of the votes, the difficulty index, the Kohavi-Wolpert variance, the interrater agreement, the generalized diversity, and the coincident failure diversity); on the accuracy of the ensemble on several binary classification problems.
* "Although there are proven connections between diversity and accuracy in some special cases, our results raise some doubts about the usefulness of diversity measures in building classifier ensembles in real-life pattern recognition problems."
* "We found that all measures had approximately equally strong relationships with the improvement of the majority vote. Also, the measures were strongly correlated between themselves."
